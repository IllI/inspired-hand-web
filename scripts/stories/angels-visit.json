We rushed Milly to the emergency veterinarian clinic, where she was diagnosed with two broken legs and internal bleeding – it was a miracle she was alive at all. She was stabilized, put into a cast, and released back in good health."

The vet who saved her life couldn't figure out what was happening and was only able to give more medications at this point. Still, it had gotten so bad that Milly couldn't function some days. I was worried we did the wrong thing by trying to save her life."

One held Milly's paw, while the other's hands were placed on Milly's back as they hovered. It was then that I felt God's protection and I was ashamed at my doubt and anger."
